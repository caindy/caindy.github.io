# Choosing the Right Tech

So you want to build your startup, but you're paralyzed by choosing what
technology stack to use. Read on friend.

### Time to v0.1.0

The only thing that matters is minimizing the time it takes for you to release a
version that you can show to your friends.

Therefore--

### Use What You Know

At least for the first version. Choosing a new stack scratches the dopamine itch
and you will loose sight of the efficacy of the endeavor. Learning cool tech is
not the goal. Remember, Facebook was built with PHP, Twitter with Rails, and
there's plenty of Perl and C++ behind the glittering fa√ßades of the post-Bootstrap era.

### What Are You Building?

There are technologies that are particularly well-suited to problems, and
choosing to use one of these for the right problem can make it easier to
build the final product you envision.

But, the product you envision isn't what will ultimately succeed in the
market. The goal is to get into a fast cadence of shipping, learning, and
repeating. There are no magic bullets.

You should have a clear problem definition in mind, preferably one that you can get
someone to pay you to solve. No one asks for a Scala or a Haskell or an Elixir
solution to their problems.

### The Tech Doesn't Matter

Hopefully, some day, it will. Hopefully, some day you will have money to hire
people to spend time tuning. Right now, you just need to start learning about
your business.

Vendors today are offering crazy amounts of cool tech on tap. It's easy to
become mesmerized by all the possibilities that this stuff offers.
Unfortunately, that's thinking about problems from the wrong end of things.

Granted there are lots of opportunities for making pickaxes right now, but if
you aren't making tech for makers, then the technology you use simply doesn't
matter.
